## 📈 Why This Matters

The intersection of AI, education, and workforce development represents a fundamental shift in how we think about human capital development. Three trends are converging:

1. **Skills Crisis:** 50% of employees need reskilling by 2025
2. **AI Democratization:** Advanced AI tools now accessible to smaller players
3. **Emerging Market Growth:** Africa and SE Asia leading global EdTech expansion

The "hire-train-retain" value chain is being rebuilt from the ground up.
